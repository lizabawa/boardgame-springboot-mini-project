# boardgame-springboot-mini-project

## Description
- This is a Springboot application that allows a user to login and add their boardgames to a list

## Tools and Technologies Used

## Approach
- I started by creating my user stories and a ERD diagram so that I could brainstorm the direction I wanted my project to take, as well as the relationships between the tables.

## Unsolved Problems and Major Hurdles

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to login so that I can create categories and boardgame lists.
- As a user, I want to add, update, and delete categories and boardgames, so I can maintain my lists.
- As a user, I want to set my login information, so I can login using that information.
- As a user, I want to login using accurate credentials, so that my account can only be accessed with the accurate credentials.
